# CNN-Project-Dog-Breed-Classifier
In this project, we will build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, we will make important design decisions about the user experience.
